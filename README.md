# Learning-Core-Audio-Swift-SampleCode

This repo is my practice for learning Apple Core Audio API. Thanks **Chris Adamson** and **Kevin Avila** two authors they created the book, **[Learning Core Audio: A Hands-On Guide to Audio Programming for Mac and iOS](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Core-Audio-Hands-Programming/dp/0321636848)**. This book let me have a gentle guide to walk through the basic of audio programming. 

Practice is the best way to learn something you are not familiar with. Therefore, I decided to use Swift to do practices on the original sample codes which were written in C/Objective-C.

I wish I could learn more about unsafe Swift and also audio programming at the same time in this practice. 

If you happen to learn Core Audio as well as using this book, you may want to see the Swift version sample code. Hope this repo will help you.

If you would like to share your Swift knowledge to make these sample code better, please send me PR. I will be happy to learn from it.
